Well now you can. WaxySeal implements a license / permit / certificate store over the top of a certificate transparency compliant SSL certificate authority. To that end this django web app implements the certificate transparency audit API (for more info read the RFC http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6962/ and have a look at the website http://www.certificate-transparency.org/)\r\n\r\nFor more info check out the docs folder.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n_Development_\r\n\r\nTo ensure verifiable, repeatable builds we use peep to pip to absolute hashed versions of code, so that we know that from a security POV, the built webapp is as was intended. See SECURITY.md for more thoughts on securing your installation and how to develope securely for waxyseal.\r\n\r\n* Create a new python virtualenv\r\n* cd ./src\r\n* run peep install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n\r\n* Implement CT public read only API\r\n* Build permit issuing API\r\n* Design URI scheme for certificates.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
